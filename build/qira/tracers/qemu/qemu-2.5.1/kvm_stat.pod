=head1 NAME

kvm_stat - Report KVM kernel module event counters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

usage: kvm_stat [OPTION]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION


kvm_stat prints counts of KVM kernel module trace events.  These events signify
state transitions such as guest mode entry and exit.

This tool is useful for observing guest behavior from the host perspective.
Often conclusions about performance or buggy behavior can be drawn from the
output.

The set of KVM kernel module trace events may be specific to the kernel version
or architecture.  It is best to check the KVM kernel module source code for the
meaning of events.

Note that trace events are counted globally across all running guests.
